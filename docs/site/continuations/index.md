# The continued version of [uTube](https://common-codes.github.io/OpenSource-uTube)
###### Brought to you by [Common-Codes](https://github.com/Common-Codes)

### This instance is approved by 10 of the 13 original developers, and worked on by 4 of the original developers.

The original slogan:
> YouTube, but it's Open Source and Google **Monetisation** free

Still stands with our version.

Although we do use some Google Services to provide the site, to keep costs down, we don't allow any third-party monetisation on any official instance of uTube.

You can see a full list of our dependencies on the repo's [Readme](https://github.com/Common-Codes/OpenSource-uTube/blob/main/README.md).

As we are using the official API, which is a `read-all` API. Any data collected* or used* is available publicly.

To keep the Open Source going, we use a Self-Hosted Plausible instance for collecting completely anonymous stats. <!-- link plausible doc things -->

###### *channel data, video data, and all follow-up data collected or used on the site, excluding hashed emails and passwords.
