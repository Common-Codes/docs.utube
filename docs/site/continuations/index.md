# The continued version of [uTube](https://common-codes.github.io/OpenSource-uTube)
###### Brought to you by [Common-Codes](https://github.com/Common-Codes)

### This instance is approved by 9 of the 13 original developers, and worked on by 4 of the original developers.

The original slogan:
> YouTube, but it's Open Source and Google **Monetisation** free

Still stands with our version.

Although we do use some Google Services to provide the site, to keep costs down, we don't allow any third-party monetisation on any official instance of uTube.

You can see a full list of our dependencies on the repo's [Readme](https://github.com/Common-Codes/OpenSource-uTube/blob/main/README.md).

As we are using the official API, which is `read-all` by the way, any data collected* or used* is available publicly.

To keep the site from making money for other companies behind our backs while collecting site stats and metrics, we use a [Self-Hosted](https://plausible.io/docs/self-hosting) instance of [Plausible](https://plausible.io/), to keep all your site navigations completely anonymous.

We can never know who it was that watched any particular video or visited any exact page.

Furthermore, all the 'Privacy Settings' from YouTube are always enabled on uTube.

###### *channel data, video data, followers data and all follow-up data (if any) collected or used on the site, excluding hashed emails and passwords.
