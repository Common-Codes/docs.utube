# Contributing Guidelines
### Please read carefully before committing a change or making a PR

### Further Reading
- To make these docs easier to read we have a standard that we try to apply on all docs, where: [square brackets] represent an object, {curly brackets} represent lists, and (brackets) represent something is mandatory or must be applied.
- We also try to keep the information displayed on these docs as accurate as possible. We, the Common-Codes Team, rigorously test changes made to the API before publishing any help or articles we have worked on here. We don't expect you to do the same, but when you find an error in this documentation, we really appreciate any feedback you give us.
